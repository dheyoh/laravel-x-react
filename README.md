This is an example project of building a web application especially **SPA(Single Page Application)** with Laravel+ReactJS.

Almost all code(in JS) are well documented *with comment* :) So you can know how the code works.

This web app is **Client Side Rendering** and not **Server Side Rendering**. How it is important?
